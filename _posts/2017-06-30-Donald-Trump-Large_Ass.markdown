## Trumps' Ass can barely make it through the door of Marine 1.

It is official that Donald Trump now has the largest ass of any president in US history.  Trump's read-end now measures a phenomenal 48 inches.  He is able to hide it much of the time by employing extremely well paid tailors to design his suits.

The heaviest president in US history was William Howard Taft, who topped the scales at 335 pounds.  Trump does weigh somewhat less at 318 pounds.  However, Trump’s body build is different.  “Taft’s body-build was more endomorphic, which means that he carried his weight higher on his body,”  says Dr. Richard Grainger of St. Cloud University.  “To the contraire, President Trump’s body is more pear-shaped.”  Dr. Grainger researches body shapes to optimize methods for improved health of any body-types.  He has studied the body shapes of all the US presidents.
 
“He’s like a duck,” states Grainger.  “He carries his fat low on his body.  When he eats a donut, it is sort of like gluing it on his glutinous maximum.”

“The president’s ass is not large at all,” says Press Secretary Sean Spicer.  “In fact, it is the smallest of any US president in the history of the office.  I have measured it myself, many times.  It is really tiny.  It sort of reminds me of a Barbie doll.”

When questioned about is body-shape, Trump retorted, “ My ass is tremendous, I mean it is great, all right?  It is perfect, ok?  I have never exercised a day in my life, and my body is phenomenal.”

>”I don’t really like to look at his body,” says first lady Melania Trump.  “It might be the biggest, no?, but I think President Coca’s was quite large too, no?”

When questioned to whom she was referring, concerning President Coca, Mrs. Trump smiled and left.
