## 2nd Law of Thermodynamics continues to inhibit energy growth.

"Smart people, very smart people, some of which I am like, are now saying that this so called "law" has inhibited energy growth for far too long.  Sad!"  The president tweeted on April 4 2017.

When press secretary Sean Spicer was asked to which law the president was referring, he indicated that it was the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics.  “We are being told that this law, and others like it, have been restricting human growth for many years.”

To look into the matter further, the president has called upon the formation of a committee consisting of members from the House of Representatives, the Senate, his Science Advisor, and Dr. Oz.  “The law dates back, way back…Ok?”  The president said, “ and frankly, it existed even before President Obama, I’m being told.  However, he [Obama] did nothing about it, all right?...and now, it’s a disaster.”

Reaction from the scientific community has been mixed.  “He’s a bafoon!” says Dr. Benjamin Nepoloni of the University of Arizonia.  “The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics is a basic construct of the universe.  It is not subject to the will of the government.”  However, Dr. Patrick Gertz of Liberty University states, “It is  about time that we have a president willing to challenge these fundamental laws.”

>This 2nd Law, not even the first by the way, was pushed by a congressman, Sadi Carnot, a long time ago.  It has done nothing for the United States.  Removing it will be tremendous. - Trump

Little is known about long term effects of the removal of the law, but the administration is extremely optimistic.
