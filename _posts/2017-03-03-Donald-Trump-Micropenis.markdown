##Supports shocked as they discover new unsavory details of the leader of the free world.

In a new study conducted by New York University, Dr. Ian Brady has determined that it is "at least 96%" likely that President Trump has what is officially called a "micropenis".

"The most surprising part" said Dr Brady, "is that, for his size, his hands are actually quite large."

"I could have told you that" said his alleged wife Melania, upon being questioned.

The president has not responded to these allegations officially, however, he did take to his Twitter account this morning to say:

> New York University, which I hear is very overated, has been telling lies and they should be ashamed.  Sad! #fakenews

Sean Spicer, in his daily press conference addressed the question has follows:

> The president has an enormous penis, and has always had it. No one can say for sure how big it is, but it is the largest known to humans. Period.

Other universities are looking into the claims asserted by Dr. Brady, and updates will be reported accordingly.
